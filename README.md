# Fuzzy-System
notes :
“Human Body Analysis Using Fuzzy Logic”
Read carefully the attached paper: “Human Blood Pressure and Body Temp
Analysis Using Fuzzy Logic Control System” and understand the proposed fuzzy
system presented. 

I. Analyze carefully the original paper
Inputs and outputs / Type of MFs for each variable / Rules
II. Implement the original paper system using python & show results
III. Add / replace input variables
 Adjust the fuzzy rules (cancel rules / modify rules / new rules)
 Re-implement the new system using your python fuzzy package
 Compare results of both systems
